# C++ Style Guide

Strictly follow Google's C++ style guide. It's okay to use the one you know
during training time, no need to look it up on the internet unless you don't
remember certain details.

## Key things to remember

- Headers are `.h`, implementations are `.cc`.
- Use CamelCase for function and method names.
- We're using C++23, although the style guide does not recommend C++23 yet.
- Do not use `auto` type. Use `using ...` in an anonymous namespace (`.cc` files
  only), add aliases for commonly used custom types if the type is too long.
- Throwing exceptions is strictly forbidden. Use `std::expect` to communicate
  possible error states. Try / catch blocks are only permitted if a third-party
  library may throw, but the return should be a result type. If the type name
  becomes too long with `std::expected`, create aliases for status and result
  types similar to Abseil's `Status` and `StatusOr<T>`.
- Use `std::string_view` for immutable string parameters in instead of
  `const std::string&`, use `std::span` for immutable array parameters instead
  of `const std::vector<T>&`.
